*Thanks to [Bhaeron](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Bhaeron?gameId=4187) for providing the following instructions*

For those of you who are using a controller (Xbox Controller Layout in this Tutorial) and want to use [Manual Weapon Stance](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13627) follow the following steps when playing via steam:

1. Right click your Starfield game in the library and select “Properties”:

2. Select “Controller” in the left panel and “Enable Steam Input” in the right panel. Click on “Controller Configurator” after that:

4. Click on the cogwheel icon next to “A Button” and select “Add extra command”:

5.Select “Keyboard” in the upper panel and click “X” on the virtual keyboard:

6. Click on the cogwheel icon next to “X Key”and change “Regular Press to” to “Double Press”:

When using this method you just need to time your inputs when using inventory menus to avoid triggering the X key instead of the A Button. Other than that, it basically just works. ;) Remember to reset these settings should you choose to disable the mod or play vanilla.


That’s it! Happy gaming!
