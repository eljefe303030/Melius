# Preamble
Melius is a Starfield Wabbajack mod list based on [melik173's](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/melik173?gameId=4187) excellent [Serenity of Stars - Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13465) and includes mods to make the game more immersive, combat more challenging and enjoyable, as well as adding in a number of quality of life mods and mods to improve the aesthetics. 

Stability and balanced gameplay that is challenging but rewarding are key aims of this list. 

Combat is much more challenging than vanilla Starfield. Headshots are more deadly for the player and enemies. When first starting the game you may wish to choose to concentrate on non-combat missions to build experience, acquire better equipment and perks before taking on groups of better trained factions. For example, fighting Vaâ€™ruun will be more challenging than Spacers, use of cover and the need to retreat will be more important than before. The Gameplay Guide section of this ReadMe details how you can change the difficulty significantly by adjusting the Human Damage mod's multiplier and/or you may wish to change the main difficulty settings to your prefered level of challenge. 

## Modlist

The full list of mods can be found on [Load Order Library](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/melius-3)

## Requirements
* I have tested this on an AMD 5700X3D/AMD 7800 XT and it works well. Without frame generation I get around 45fps in New Atlantis and 120 with frame generation, most other outside areas I get around 60fps without frame generation and 160fps with frame generation (much higher fps indoors). Personannly I find playing without frame generation provides the best experiance for me.
* Your computer will need to meet at least the [minimum requirements specified by Bethesda](https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/60442)
* Language set to English.
* You need the latest Steam version (1.15.222) of the game and the Shattered Space DLC.

## Pre-installation Steps
1. Install [Microsoft .NET v8.0 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.5-windows-x64-installer) and [Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
2. Fully disable OneDrive and any other programs that affect user file areas.
3. Reinstall Starfield into a location that is not Program Files. Somewhere like C:\Games is a good location [(detailed instructions on how to do this)](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4BD4-4528-6B2E-8327#:~:text=The%20default%20installation%20location%20is,Program%20Files%20(x86)%5CSteam). You **MUST** have the latest Steam version of Starfield, version 1.15.222 and it **MUST** be a clean install.
4. Set Starfield to not automatically update.
    - Right click Starfield in Steam, click Properties, disable *'Enable the Steam overlay while in-game'*.
6. Language set to English. You can check translations of the mods on NexusMods but I cannot support you with that.
7. Start Starfield via Steam once, get to the main menu and exit the game. After this step, you will not be starting the game through Steam anymore.
8. *Optional but recommended*: adjust your pagefile to at least 20gb but recommended to 40gb. Some people have reported this can prevent crashes to desktop (CTDs), if you are getting them, set your pagefile. To do this:

      a) Right click the Start Button

      b) Click System

      c) Click Advanced Systems Settings

      d) On the Advanced tab, click Settings in the Performance section

      e) On the Advanced tab, click the Change button

      f) Set the Initial Size and Maximum Size to 40000 or if you are struggling for drive space, to at least 20000.

## Using Wabbajack
1. Download the latest version of [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and place it in a folder near or at the root of your drive, e.g. C:\Wabbajack
2. Create the installation folder e.g. C:\Melius
4. Create the mod download folder e.g. C:\Melius Mod Downloads. The download folder can be on a different drive. This can be deleted after the installation has completed but is not advised, as if you want to update or reinstall, you'll need to redownload all the mods again.
5. In the WABBAJACK folder, run Wabbajack.exe to install the Wabbajack program
6. After the install has completed, run Wabbajack.exe once more
7. Make sure you are logged into Nexus. Click on the gear icon in the bottom left hand corner and click login to Nexus Mods.
8. Browse the Starfield modlists to choose Melius.
9. Choose the Mod Installation Location and Downloads Location paths you set earlier for the installation and mod download folders.
10. Click the **Install** button to start the installation.
11. If you have a premium Nexus membership, it will install automatically, if you don't, you will have to click slow download for each and every mod.
12. Once completed, it's installed.

If there are any issues with the installation, start Wabbajack again and it will continue from where it left off.

## Post-installation Steps
### Root Builder
*For your information only, this step is done automatically* 

The list uses Kezyma's Root Builder to keep the game root folder clean. Any mod that needs to be installed in the game folder is instead added to MO2 with a special file structure, and is then added to the game folder whenever the game is running.

### Stock Game 
*For your information only, this step is done automatically* 

Melius uses the Stock Game method. This is essentially a copy of Starfield included with the installation folder. This means that everything is completely separate from your Steam installation of Starfield (which is still required as the game files are not redistributed). The folder in question is called Stock Game, located at Melius\Stock Game.

### Starting Mod Organizer 2
1. Launch ModOrganizer.exe in the Melius installation folder. If you get a popup asking about nxm links. Click Yes.
2. You can safely ignore any missing masters error messages. Any mods than depend on the Constellation or Old Mars skins that you get with the Premium Edition of Starfield will be automatically disabled the first time you run the list. If you have the Constellation and Old Mars skins, copy the files over to the Stock Game/Data folder before starting the list for the first time.
   
![Premium Edition files](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/260ccf00-9c27-40e7-8179-1e5d1b7a6b7d)

4. Only launch Melius through MO2 via the 'Starfield SFSE'. **Do not start through Steam or by selecting Starfield in MO2**, as this will result in mods not working.
![start SFSE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/101caa91-dba3-4620-95ba-1a60a22f48e9)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 3. **Do not press the Unlock button** that MO2 displays after clicking run. The game may take a few minutes to start, this is normal.
4. Start a new game. I will not provide support if you use this list on an existing save game, as there could be issues from other mods you used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 4. After starting the game for the first time, the sound, elements of the user interface and other things will not work properly, save the game when you are able to, close the game down and reloading your save will correct this.

### Manuel Installations
1. Since version 1.3.0 of this modlist, a lot of HD texture mods have been removed to help reduce the mod list download size and make the list more performance friendly. If you would like to have the best possible graphics, I highly recommend you use the [Starfield HD Overhaul mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5124). This is save safe to add or remove during a playthrough. Place the plugin for this mod at the top of the load order in the right hand window.

### Modifications to the modlist
Any modifications you make to the modlist, other than the optional mods listed above, are unsupported. I would be interested to hear if you have any recommendations for mods, let me know in my Discord server.

Do not update any mods within this mod list. Reason being is that mods have been patched, both by including a patch file and binary patching. Consequences of updating mods can include mods no longer functioning as intended, to the whole mod list not working.

## Gameplay Guide

* Auto saves are disabled by default but can be enabled in the settings menu of the game.

Headshot multiplier is set to x10 which means headshots are deadly for you and most enemies, some bosses might take 2 or 3 headshots to kill them. If you want to change this, choose a different multipler from the 49.1 GENERAL COMBAT - OPTIONAL section.
* [StarUI HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3444) has been configured to not show enemy health bars or stealth meters for immersion, see the mod page for how to configure this to your tastes.

* [Fast Spacesuit Deployment Kit](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/8229) This mod gives you a toolkit that can be called from the Favorite menu, and automatically equip/unequip your current spacesuit. Whether to wear a spacesuit and helmet, now is your call. To use, go straight to Laredo Firearms located at the Akila City, on the front counter, you can see the Fast Spacesuit Deployment Kit. Pick it up (the vendor also sells it), in your inventory, go to Aid category, and add it to one of your Favorite slots. Whenever you press that hotkey, it will equip/unequip your current spacesuit. If you are wearing a spacesuit, it will remember them when unequipping, so the next time you use the item, it will equip back exactly the last spacesuits you had in your inventory. Nothing will happen if you are not wearing spacesuits or you take the spacesuit out of your inventory after the last unequipping.
* [Change Your Outfit](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/14484) This mod transforms mannequins into fully interactive outfit stations.

## Note for Content Creators

Some of the added music in the list cannot be played on YouTube/Twitch or other platforms due to DMCA rules. To circumvent this, I recommend either disabling the mod PopcornTime or disabling in-game music by lowering the volume to 0% in the audio settings.

## Known Issues

1. The mod Weapon Sound Fixes has the side effect of controller vibration for Maelstrom, Grendel and some other weapons being low to non-existent.
4. Not all the additional clothing combinations are compatible with each other and can cause visual glitches/clipping in both the preview and in game views. Choose a different combination of outfits if this occurs.
5. Using SKK Fast Start, when you start a new game, you don't have access to the landing ramp remote and the ship control menus opens, just tab out of the menu to continue **read the mod page for [Immersive Landing Ramps](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/8093) as the item you need for this mod will need to be acquired within the game for the mod to be useable**
6. If you experience strange visual artifacts or flickering, press the 'end' key. This will be fixed in the next release.
7. The quest "legacy's end" if you chose the UC side and at the stage to destroy the crimson defenders, if during the dialogue it appears one of the ships runs into the key and explodes and prevents you from progressing, disable the mod 'Deadly Ramming and Debris Fields - Medium' and load and earlier save.
8. Starting the game without fast start will produce this error message, this can safely be ignored: ![Enemies Boarding My Ship error message](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d1030ee-4158-4588-ae96-632d5441d75c)
9. Some people are reporting infinite loading screens in New Atlantis, a possible solution is to leave New Atlantis, save and exit the game, then disable the two mods New Atlantis Awaits and Positively New Atlantis. Please feedback in the Discord Support channel if this does or doesn't fix the issue for you.

## Troubleshooting

1. If you have strange visual effects, such as lights flickering when moving around or artifacting, reset your shader cache:
   
**AMD**
* Open AMD Software: Right-click on your desktop and select "AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition" or open it from the Start menu. 
* Navigate to Graphics Settings: Click the Gaming tab at the top, then select the Graphics subtab. 
* Find the Reset Option: Scroll all the way to the bottom of the graphics settings page. 
* Perform the Reset: Locate the Reset Shader Cache option and click the Perform Reset button next to it. 
* Confirm: Click OK when prompted to confirm the action.

**Nvidia**
1. Disable the cache: 
* Open the NVIDIA Control Panel, go to Manage 3D Settings > Global Settings. 
* Scroll down and find Shader Cache Size, then change the setting from the dropdown menu to Disabled. 
* Click Apply and close the NVIDIA Control Panel.
  
2. Delete the cache files: 
* Press Windows Key + R to open the Run dialog. 
* Type %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\ and press Enter. 
* Open the NVIDIA folder, then open the GLCache folder and delete all the files and folders inside. 
* Go back to the %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\ folder. 
* Find and open the NVIDIA Corporation folder. 
* Open the NV_Cache folder and delete all its contents. 
* Next, open the Run dialog again (Windows Key + R) and type %LOCALAPPDATA% (or just %APPDATA%) and press Enter. 
* Go to Local > NVIDIA > DXCache. 
* Delete all files inside the DXCache folder.
  
3. Re-enable and restart: 
* Open the NVIDIA Control Panel again. 
* Go to Manage 3D Settings > Global Settings. 
* Set Shader Cache Size back to its desired setting (or you can re-enable it). 
* Click Apply and then restart your PC.

## Updating the Modlist

Before updating the modlist, check the [changelog](https://github.com/eljefe303030/Melius/blob/main/changelog.md) and it is advisable to back up your saves first. It will state in the changelog if you need to start a new game after certain updates.

**Updating to version 3.x. It is required to install into a new folder, as there are significant changes.**

It is recommended that before updating to save the game whilst you are in space, doing nothing, sat in the cockpit, doing zero speed.

Any mods you have added to the list will be deleted and other changes you have made will be overwritten. If you want to keep additional mods you have added, add `[NoDelete]` before the mod name in the left hand pane of MO2.
![NoDelete prefix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9d88441-20be-45a2-a4dc-ad59a7a9a385)
