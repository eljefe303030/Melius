# Melius

Melius is a modlist based on Starborn Royalty. Main aim is to make the game as enjoyable as possible, whilst improving graphics, audio and adding quality of life mods.

## Pre-installation Steps

1. Install [Visual C++ x64 Redistributables](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
2. Install [Microsoft .NET 5.0 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime) and [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0/runtime) (both console apps and desktop apps x64).
3. Fully disable OneDrive and any other programs that hook into user file areas.
4. Reinstall Starfield into a location that is not Program Files. Somewhere like C:\Games is a good location. You MUST have the latest version of Starfield, version 1.14.74.0 and it MUST be a clean install.
5. Set Starfield to not automatically update.
6. Right click Starfield in Steam, click Properties, disable Enable the Steam overlay while in-game.
4. Language set to English. You can check translations of the modes on NexusMods but I cannot support you with that.

## Pagefile and Crash Prevention

To prevent crashes, you will need to set the pagefile to a minimum and maximum size of 40000
1. Press Win + R and enter sysdm.cpl
2. On the Advanced tab, select Settings under the Performance section
3. On the Advanced tab and press Change... under the Virtual Memory section

## Using Wabbajack

2. 3. Create the installatioin folder e.g. C:\Melius
4. Create the mod download folder e.g. C:\Melius mod downloads. The download folder can be on a different drive. This can be deleted after the installation has completed but is not advised, as if you want to update or reinstall, you'll need to redownload all the mods again.
5. In the WABBAJACK folder, run Wabbajack.exe to install the Wabbajack program
6. After the install has completed, run Wabbajack.exe once more
7. Browse the Starfield modlists to choose Melius. You may need to filter by unoffical lists.
8. Choose the Mod Installation Location and Resource Download Location paths you set earlier for the installation and mod download folders.
9. If you have a premium Nexus membership, it will install automatically, if you don't, you will have to click slow download for each and every mod.
