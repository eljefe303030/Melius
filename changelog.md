</details>

## Version 3.0.1
Very small hotfix that is safe game safe from 3.0.

* Updated Serenity of Stars, as alternate ammunition crafting granted the player the required materials instead of consuming them.
* Removed powerofthree's Tweaks SFSE
* Added ammo to the weapons inventory screen

## Version 3.0

**This is a major update and will require a new game, it will not be save safe.** This will no longer have two profiles and instead one profile based on the [Serenity of Stars - Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13465) mod. I have had to make the decision to make having Shattered Space as a requirement, as too many mods need this. On the plus side, it will make installation of the modlist easier (no more having to manually copy across files). Starvival will no longer be used and instead replaced with several other mods that cover some of the systems.

I've done some tidying up of how optional mods work, again making it easier for you to find and enable them. Everything will be done in the left hand window of MO2 now.

I'm not listing the changes, as there are too many, consider this a new mod list.

## Version 2.2

**This version will need a new game.**

Updated to work with latest Starfield update (1.15.216). Adds some bug fixes and adds mods that provide some visual and gameplay improvements. 

No major changes in this update, as this is designed to get the list working with 1.15.216. The version after this is planned to be a major update.

<details>

## Version 2.0
**This version will need a new game. Updating to this version with an existing save can cause save game corruption.**

If you upgrade instead, do not use the old profiles, instead use one of the two new profiles. Remember to copy across the Shattered Space files (as described in the Readme) if you have them.**

**If you are struggling for drive space, delete your installation folder but not your downloads folder and treat it as a new installation. Backup your save games first, so you can revert to the previous version later if you so desire.**

Adds a number of mods that provide some visual, audio and gameplay improvements/changes. Changed profiles in MO2 to make them more user friendly i.e. removed separate profiles for DLC and non-DLC. Added an additional profile with a more hardcore gameplay style based on Ascension instead of Royal Galaxy. Changed Immersive Landing Ramps mod to an optional mod and therefore hopefully forcing new users to read the ReadMe before enabling and not get stuck with not knowing how to open the landing ramp.
