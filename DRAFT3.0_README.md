# Preamble
Melius is a Starfield Wabbajack mod list based on [melik173's](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/melik173?gameId=4187) excellent [Serenity of Stars - Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13465) and includes mods to make the game more immersive, combat more challenging and enjoyable, as well as adding in a number of quality of life mods and mods to improve the aesthetics. 

Stability and balanced gameplay that is challenging but rewarding are key aims of this list. 

## Modlist

The full list of mods can be found on [Load Order Library](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/melius-3)

## Requirements
* I have tested this on an AMD 5700X3D/AMD 7800 XT and it works well without any noticeable drops in FPS.
* Your computer will need to meet at least the [minimum requirements specified by Bethesda](https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/60442)
* Language set to English.
* You need the latest Steam version (1.15.216) of the game and the Shattered Space DLC.

## Pre-installation Steps
1. Install [Microsoft .NET v8.0 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.5-windows-x64-installer) and [Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
2. Fully disable OneDrive and any other programs that affect user file areas.
3. Reinstall Starfield into a location that is not Program Files. Somewhere like C:\Games is a good location [(detailed instructions on how to do this)](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4BD4-4528-6B2E-8327#:~:text=The%20default%20installation%20location%20is,Program%20Files%20(x86)%5CSteam). You MUST have the latest Steam version of Starfield, version 1.15.216 and it MUST be a clean install.
4. Set Starfield to not automatically update.
    - Right click Starfield in Steam, click Properties, disable *'Enable the Steam overlay while in-game'*.
6. Language set to English. You can check translations of the mods on NexusMods but I cannot support you with that.
7. Start Starfield via Steam once, get to the main menu and exit the game. After this step, you will be starting the game through Steam anymore.

## Using Wabbajack
1. Download the latest version of [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and place it in a folder near or at the root of your drive, e.g. C:\Wabbajack
2. Create the installation folder e.g. C:\Melius
4. Create the mod download folder e.g. C:\Melius Mod Downloads. The download folder can be on a different drive. This can be deleted after the installation has completed but is not advised, as if you want to update or reinstall, you'll need to redownload all the mods again.
5. In the WABBAJACK folder, run Wabbajack.exe to install the Wabbajack program
6. After the install has completed, run Wabbajack.exe once more
7. Make sure you are logged into Nexus. Click on the gear icon in the bottom left hand corner and click login to Nexus Mods.
8. Browse the Starfield modlists to choose Melius.
9. Choose the Mod Installation Location and Downloads Location paths you set earlier for the installation and mod download folders.
10. Click the **Install** button to start the installation.
11. If you have a premium Nexus membership, it will install automatically, if you don't, you will have to click slow download for each and every mod.
12. Once completed, it's installed.

If there are any issues with the installation, start Wabbajack again and it will continue from where it left off.

## Post-installation Steps
### Root Builder
*For your information only, this step is done automatically* 

The list uses Kezyma's Root Builder to keep the game root folder clean. Any mod that needs to be installed in the game folder is instead added to MO2 with a special file structure, and is then added to the game folder whenever the game is running.

### Stock Game 
*For your information only, this step is done automatically* 

Melius uses the Stock Game method. This is essentially a copy of Starfield included with the installation folder. This means that everything is completely separate from your Steam installation of Starfield (which is still required as the game files are not redistributed). The folder in question is called Stock Game, located at Melius\Stock Game.

### Starting Mod Organizer 2
1. Launch ModOrganizer.exe in the Melius installation folder. If you get a popup asking about nxm links. Click Yes.

2. Only launch Melius through MO2 via the 'Starfield SFSE'. **Do not start through Steam or by selecting Starfield in MO2**, as this will result in mods not working.
![start SFSE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/101caa91-dba3-4620-95ba-1a60a22f48e9)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 3. **Do not press the Unlock button** that MO2 displays after clicking run. The game may take a few minutes to start, this is normal.
4. Start a new game. I will not provide support if you use this list on an existing save game, as there could be issues from other mods you used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 4. After starting the game for the first time, the sound, elements of the user interface and other things will not work properly, save the game when you are able to, close the game down and reloading your save will correct this.

When you start a new game with this mod, the ship control menu will pop up, tab to close this and continue.**
  
### Manuel Installations
1. Since version 1.3.0 of this modlist, a lot of HD texture mods have been removed to help reduce the mod list download size and make the list more performance friendly. If you would like to have the best possible graphics, I highly recommend you use the [Starfield HD Overhaul mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5124). This is save safe to add or remove during a playthrough.

### Modifications to the modlist
Any modifications you make to the modlist, other than the optional mods listed above, are unsupported. I would be interested to hear if you have any recommendations for mods, let me know in my Discord server.

Do not update any mods within this mod list. Reason being is that mods have been patched, both by including a patch file and binary patching. Consequences of updating mods can include mods no longer functioning as intended, to the whole mod list not working.

## Gameplay Guide

* Auto saves are disabled by default but can be enabled in the settings menu of the game.
* [Baka Quick Full Saves](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1750) changes quick saves to full saves, which means you will have more saves and will need to periodically delete saves as and when needed.
* [Short Temple Puzzles](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1139) changes the number of puzzles to 3.
* [Build Outpost Items with Credits](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/11890) Allows you to build all outpost/ship objects with credits instead of resources.
* [Sit To Add Ship to Fleet](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6493) Sit in pilot seat to add captured ship to your fleet. No need to make it your home ship.
* [Leave No Witnesses](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/12000) Reworks player bounties so that killing all witnesses to a crime you commit in space removes the bounties incurred while committing that crime.
* [Landing Bay Cargo Access](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/11972) Adds an interactive cargo panel to each landing bay module, allowing you to access your ship's cargo hold remotely - at your ship, but outside your ship. If the cargo panel doesn't show up on your ship, you may have to refresh your ship's landing bay cell by modifying your ship in the ship builder.
* [Polyamory - Remove single romance limit](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10687) Removes the restriction on multiple companion romances.
* [Human Damage (Just a Flesh Wound - Bullet in the Head)](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/12603) Changes the damage multiple for the different areas of body parts of humans to make the game more fun and rewards better aiming. Headshot multiplier is set to x10 which means headshots are deadly for you and most enemies, some bosses might take 2 or 3 headshots to kill them. If you want to change this, right click the mod and choose reinstall, which give you a choice of headshot multiplier (x2 is vanilla). Make sure to place it in the correct position in the right hand pane, immediately below the El Jefe Combat AI mod.
* [StarUI HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3444) has been configured to not show enemy health bars or stealth meters for immersion, see the mod page for how to configure this to your tastes. Crosshairs have also been disabled, these can be displayed by changing the game 'interface' setting.
* [Starware Search Engine - SFSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13643) Implements a search engine to the Galaxy StarMap Menu, allowing you to find any location and planet within seconds. Press 'q' in the starmap to use.
* [Serenity of Stars - Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13465) overhauls the gameplay in many ways. Additional control keys - Sensor Array mod for helmets adds Night Vision. Default key to activate is "N". There is a new menu to swap attachments (ammo, muzzle, scope and firing mode) without the need of a workbench. Default key to bring up the menu is "B"

## Note for Content Creators

Some of the added music in the list cannot be played on YouTube/Twitch or other platforms due to DMCA rules. To circumvent this, I recommend either disabling the mod PopcornTime or disabling in-game music by lowering the volume to 0% in the audio settings.

## Known Issues

1. The mod Weapon Sound Fixes has the side effect of controller vibration for Maelstrom, Grendel and some other weapons being low to non-existent.
4. Not all the additional clothing combinations are compatible with each other and can cause visual glitches/clipping in both the preview and in game views. Choose a different combination of outfits if this occurs.
5. Using SKK Fast Start, when you start a new game, you don't have access to the landing ramp remote and the ship control menus opens, just tab out of the menu to continue **read the mod page for [Immersive Landing Ramps](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/8093) as the item you need for this mod will need to be acquired within the game for the mod to be useable**
6. Crosshairs for some weapons are unavailable and will need a patch to bring them back.

## Changelog

Version 3.0

**This version will need a new game.**

Complete rewrite of the mod list. This is a major update and will require a new game, it will not be save safe. This will no longer have two profiles and instead one profile based on the [Serenity of Stars - Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13465) mod. I have had to make the decision to make having Shattered Space as a requirement, as too many mods need this. On the plus side, it will make installation of the modlist easier (no more having to manually copy across files). Starvival will no longer be used and instead replaced with several other mods that cover some of the systems.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/eljefe303030/Melius/blob/main/changelog.md)

## Updating the Modlist

Before updating the modlist, check the [changelog](https://github.com/eljefe303030/Melius/blob/main/changelog.md) and it is advisable to back up your saves first. It will state in the changelog if you need to start a new game after certain updates.

**Updating to version 3.x. It is required to install into a new folder, as there are significant changes.**

It is recommended that before updating to save the game whilst you are in space, doing nothing, sat in the cockpit, doing zero speed.

Any mods you have added to the list will be deleted and other changes you have made will be overwritten. If you want to keep additional mods you have added, add `[NoDelete]` before the mod name in the left hand pane of MO2.
![NoDelete prefix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9d88441-20be-45a2-a4dc-ad59a7a9a385)

Updating is the same process as installing the list. Make sure your paths are the same. 

If you get a message like the below, choose 'No'
![Missing content](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60522711-6dde-46b1-a8e6-c006d28eca17)

If the update has removed any mods, you'll get the following message, choose 'Yes'
![Content not present](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d66fafc1-2c54-4adf-9b72-a52b55667c1b)
